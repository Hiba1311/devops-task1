 CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Web App

This project demonstrates the process of automating code deployment using CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Node.js, and Docker. The pipeline is set up to build, test, and deploy the app every time changes are pushed to the main branch.

 Project Overview

- Objective: Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing, building, and deployment of a simple Node.js app.
- Tools Used:
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
  - Docker for containerizing the Node.js app
  - Node.js for the web application
  - DockerHub for storing the Docker image
 How the Pipeline Works

1. Test: The pipeline will run tests on the code to ensure everything works as expected.
2. Build: The app will be built and containerized using Docker.
3. Push: The Docker image will be pushed to DockerHub for deployment.

This process will be automatically triggered whenever code is pushed to the `main` branch.

Getting Started Locally

To run the Node.js app locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nodejs-demo-app.git
   cd nodejs-demo-app
   

2. Install dependencies:
   bash
   npm install
   

3. Start the app:
   bash
   node index.js
   

4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the app running.

 Docker Setup

This project uses Docker to containerize the Node.js app.

 To build and run the Docker container locally:

1. Build the Docker image:
   bash
   docker build -t nodejs-demo-app .
   

2. Run the Docker container:
   bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 nodejs-demo-app
   

3. Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
